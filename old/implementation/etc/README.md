 - assembly_code.txt contains our custom assembly code before we decided to implement the whole algorithm in the datapath.

 - assembly_code_MIPS contains working assembly code executed in MARS, using the stack.

 - assembly_code_MIPS_test contains the same code as assembly_code_MIPS, but changes all register values to -1 inbetween calls to the stack to verify our stack was saving values correctly.

 - output.txt contains the output of our basic assembler written in python3.

 - python_assembler.py contains the python code for our assembler.
